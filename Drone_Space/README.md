# Drone-Space-Pygame

A pygame Implementation for a simple game

This is a part of a series of HyperionDev Capstone Projects, I will be creating a simple game using Pygame.
Pygame is a library of code that allows one to create simple games using Python.

1. Drone Space

# HyperionDev Capstone Projects Instrctions 

Open the example.py file in the game folder. example.py contains a very
simple game coded with pygame. The player can move up and down with
the arrow keys and must avoid colliding with the ‘enemy’ to win. Read
through the code and comments and run the game to see how to create
a game with pygame.

Create your own game based on the code in example.py (you do not have
to write your game from scratch). Your game should include:

	One ‘player’ object. You should be able to move the player around
	the screen by using the up, down, left and right arrows.
	
	At least 3 ‘enemy’ objects. The enemies should all move across the
	screen from different positions. If the player object collides with any
	enemy object, they lose, and the game ends.
	
	At least 1 ‘prize’ object. If the player object collides with the prize
	object, they win, and the game ends.
